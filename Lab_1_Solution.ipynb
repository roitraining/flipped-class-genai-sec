        "2. Check model responses for sensitive data\n",

        "The first template is simpler. You are just enable the __Prompt injection and Jailbreak detection__.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second template uses __Google Sensitive Data protection__ service templates for detecting and then redacting sensitive data. You need to create two templates in SDP, an inspection template and a de-identify template.\n",
